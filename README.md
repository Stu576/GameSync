# GameSync


GameSync is a solution to a problem i face when playing retro games across multiple systems. It should be a lot easier to have these saves work across different platforms. The current iteration will support Windows and work as a centralised location for connecting to network storage and comparing file edit times. The future of this application will come in the form of a dedicated application that will run on the homebrewed system itself and connect to different storage locations.

The project is born from the fact that I play games across multiple systems. I may start a GameBoy Colour game on my Nintendo 3DS, but then decide i want to continue this on my iPad via Delta. After having to move file manually for a short while, i decided it is time to get this process automated.
